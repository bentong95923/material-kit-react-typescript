# Material Kit React Typed

This repo is a clone of the free Material Kit React (not the PRO version) downloaded from the [Create Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-kit-react/) website but is converted to TypeScript. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and migrate the original JavaScript files and other resources then converted to .ts/.tsx files.

Original repo: [material-kit-react](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/material-kit-react)

The reason that I converted to TypeScript is because I would like to create a react (in TypeScript) for my personal blog, and would like to use Material Kit React as the UI, since Material Kit React in TypeScript is not officially supported ([#63](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/material-kit-react/issues/63), [#55](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/material-kit-react/issues/55)).

Please feel free to clone / fork this repo and open an issue if you have encountered any issues while using it.
