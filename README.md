# Material Kit React Typed

Creater: Creative Tim Official
Converted by Benjamin Tong

This repo is a clone of the free Material Kit React (not the PRO version) downloaded from the [Create Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-kit-react/) website but is converted to TypeScript by hand. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and migrate the original JavaScript files and other resources then converted to .ts/.tsx files.

Original repo: [material-kit-react](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/material-kit-react)

The reason that I converted to TypeScript is because I would like to create a react (in TypeScript) for my personal blog, and would like to use Material Kit React as the UI, since Material Kit React in TypeScript is not officially supported ([#63](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/material-kit-react/issues/63), [#55](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/material-kit-react/issues/55)). Even though it is not officially support, but really love the design and hence created this repo (and thank you so much to Create Tim to have this beautiful design to make it free for anyone).

Please feel free to clone / fork this repo or open an issue if you have encountered any issues while using it.
